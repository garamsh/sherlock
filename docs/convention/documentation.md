# Documentation Conventions

What makes documentation valid in this project. Applies to every file under `docs/`, to every `README.md` in the tree, to prose in build and configuration files, and to GitHub artifacts (issues, PRs, comments). Violations are grounds for PR rejection.

## Keep it maintainable

- **No ASCII art or text diagrams.** Boxes, arrows, and trees drawn with characters break on every edit. Express structure as bulleted lists of paths with one-sentence descriptions, or link to the code.
- **No implementation detail.** Code is the source of truth for how things work; docs record what exists and why. Do not transcribe function signatures, line-level behavior, or config dumps — they rot.
- **One file, one responsibility.** Split files by topic, not by length. A file that outgrows a single topic does not get a Contents list as a remedy — it gets split by responsibility, with each piece serving one topic.
- **Lists and tables over prose.** A rule scannable in 5 seconds beats a paragraph.

## Keep it current

- A PR that changes structure, workflow, or conventions updates the affected docs in the same PR. Stale docs are worse than missing docs.
- Delete docs that no longer describe anything real. Do not archive.
- Every claim about this repository must be verifiable in it. If you cannot point at it, remove it.
- A claim about anything outside it names what it holds for, precisely enough that a reader can check it there: a release where the project publishes them, a commit where it does not. `deprecated in v2` can be checked against the library and `deprecated` cannot; a path and a line number with neither looks precise and goes on looking valid after the line moves.
- A file may state once at the top what it was checked against, and then every claim in it holds for that. That statement records a check; it promises nothing about later versions. A reader past it holds claims nobody checked there, and moving the statement means re-checking the claims under it rather than editing the number.
- Where the claim is about a package's health rather than a release (`unmaintained`, `legacy`), do not rest a rule on it: name what to use instead, which does not expire.
- A claim about a project beyond this one cannot be checked from here, so it is written as an obligation and not as a description. "`findOneByOrFail` throws, which the global filter maps" asserts a filter this file has never seen; "`findOneByOrFail` throws; map it in the filter at X" is a rule the reader can act on and a reviewer can look for.
- Update an existing document when the topic is already covered there; do not create a parallel document for a new facet of the same topic. Total document volume is a managed cost — a new file earns its place by adding a topic no existing file owns.

## GitHub artifacts

Issues, PRs, and comments are documentation too.

- **Facts only.** No rhetoric, no self-assessment, no inflated language ("perfect", "massive improvement"). State what changed, where, and why.
- **Stay inside the template.** No extra sections beyond the template fields; leave no field empty — write `N/A` with a reason.
- **One comment, one point.** A comment carries a single request, instruction, or question. Ground it by citing a path or a rule, not by arguing.
- **An issue that can be met literally while its goal fails is malformed.** Where it enumerates cases, checks, or candidates, say whether the list bounds the work — unmarked, a reader takes it as the definition. Where it asks for a measurement, say what condition makes a null result an answer rather than a run that never exercised the thing.

## Format

- English and Markdown. The H1 takes the case of what it is — a name in title case, an exact file or repository name as spelled, a statement in sentence case (an ADR's H1 states its decision). Every heading below it is sentence case.
- Start each file with one line stating what it governs.
- A file past ~50 lines opens with a `## Contents` list of its section headings; a shorter one does not. A Contents list is never the remedy for a file that has outgrown one topic — see §Keep it maintainable.
- **No decoration.** No emojis, badges, or ornamental headers. This holds for files under `docs/` as much as for GitHub artifacts: a check-mark glyph in a table is decoration where `yes` is a word.
- Use file paths (`src/auth/service.ts`) instead of drawn hierarchies.
- File names: lowercase kebab-case (`runtime-safety.md`). Uppercase is reserved for files a tool or a reader looks for by an exact name it did not choose: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the names GitHub requires under `.github/`.
