# Review Conventions

What makes a PR review valid, and how authors respond. Applies to every review and every response; violations are grounds for rejection.

## Submitting a review

- **Reviews are formal.** Decisions are submitted as approve / request changes / comment via the review mechanism — never as bare comments. Review states gate merges; comments do not.
- **Every review body carries the evidence table**, approval included:

```
| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | pass / fail / unverified | — |
| Conventions | … | rule file §section — diff file:line |
| Architecture | … | … |
| Documentation | … | … |
| Verification | … | … |
| Depth | … | … |

Decision: approve / request changes / reject
```

- An approve requires the Scope, Verification, and Depth rows to read `pass`. The other three may read `unverified`, with a stated reason (some PRs touch nothing a convention governs). A `fail` in any row is a request-changes or a reject, never an approve.
- A check you did not verify is marked `unverified` — never guessed. Skipping a check is allowed; hiding the skip is not. A review full of `unverified` rows tells the reader the review did not really happen.
- **Reject maps to request changes.** GitHub has no `reject` review state, so a reject decision is submitted as a request-changes review whose decision line reads `reject` (in single-account setups, the `comment` substitute per §Single-account setups). What reject does that request changes does not: the reviewer closes the PR and files an issue describing the right direction.

## What each check verifies

| Check | Fails when |
|---|---|
| Scope | The diff carries a line the stated task did not ask for. |
| Conventions | A changed line breaks a rule in a file that governs it. |
| Architecture | A decision or a domain changed without the documents that describe it. |
| Documentation | A change to structure, workflow, or conventions left an affected document stale. |
| Verification | The PR claims a check the reviewer cannot confirm ran. |
| Depth | The change obeys every rule and is still the wrong thing to keep. |

**Scope** is measured against the task the pull request states — its issue where one exists, its Summary where none does — never against taste. A line that traces to an acceptance criterion is in scope however large it is, and a correct one-line drive-by is out of scope however small. Out-of-scope work is not wrong — it is a separate issue.

**Depth** is the check the other five cannot make. They ask whether the change follows the rules; Depth asks whether it is right: a correctness risk the tests do not cover, a materially simpler approach passed over, a defect no convention happens to name. Marking it `pass` asserts the reviewer looked for those and found none, so it is the one row that cannot be filled without reading the change itself.

## Citing violations

- A violation claim cites both sides: `rule file §section` and `diff file:line`.
- If you cannot cite a rule, it is a preference, and preferences never block a merge.
- A Depth finding is the exception the check exists for. It names no rule by definition, so it cites the diff and the concrete failure it produces instead — the input that breaks, the case the tests miss, the simpler shape passed over. That is citable, and it blocks.

## Blockers and nits

- Tag every requested change **blocker** or **nit**.
- A nit never blocks a merge. A blocker always states the expected fix direction — "wrong" without "do this instead" is noise.

## Single-account setups

When the PM and authors share one GitHub account, `comment` is the only review state GitHub accepts on one's own pull request — `approve` and `request changes` are both refused. Every decision is submitted as a `comment` review carrying the evidence table and its decision line, plus one line saying the state was substituted because GitHub allows no other. That comment is the review; it is not a bare comment.

- **Approve.** Post the review, then merge immediately — the merge is the approval.
- **Request changes.** Post the review and leave the PR open. The author responds to it as to any request-changes review.

## Responding to a review (author)

- Address every blocker, or rebut it by citing a rule or path that supports your approach. Silent ignoring is not allowed.
- Answer nits too: fix, or state briefly why not.
- Respond on the same branch and the same pull request; never open a replacement.
