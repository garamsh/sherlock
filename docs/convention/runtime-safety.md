## Core principle

A runtime error is a bug the type system let through. Catch as many as possible at compile time and parse time; production code then only does what the types prove it can do.

## Type system

Enable the strictest mode your stack supports — strict nullability, no implicit escape to an "unknown/any/object" shape, no implicit conversions. Strictness catches more bugs at compile time than it costs in effort.

- **No silent assertions.** Type assertions, lint suppressions, and unchecked casts silence the type system without fixing the underlying mismatch. Find the root cause; if you must assert, attach a brief inline comment with the reason.
- **Non-nullable by default.** A type that allows absence everywhere spreads absence-handling through every caller. Mark absence explicitly (with an `Option` / `Maybe` / `Result` shape or a nullable wrapper) only where it is a real state — never as a default.
- **Domain primitives over raw types.** Define `UserId`, `Money`, `Email` as distinct named types (newtypes, branded types, value objects) rather than as raw strings or numbers. They prevent passing the wrong value at the type level.

## Boundaries

External data is untrusted. The boundary between outside and inside is where you prove what's true.

- **Parse, don't validate.** A function that returns a parsed type (or throws at the boundary) is stronger than one that returns the raw input alongside a boolean validation result. After parse, downstream code trusts the type.
- **Validate once at the boundary** — HTTP request body, file read, env var, DB row, third-party API response. Don't re-validate at every call downstream.
- **The boundary returns a typed wrapper** so the rest of the codebase cannot accidentally pass the raw form.

## Illegal states

A type that allows `{ isPaid: true, isShipped: false }` and `{ isPaid: false, isShipped: true }` will eventually be misused. Encode state precisely.

- **Discriminated union / sum type** for a finite set of variants. The type system rules out impossible combinations (e.g., "shipped but unpaid" cannot be represented).
- **Avoid orthogonal boolean flags** as state — encode combinations as variants.
- **Make invalid combinations unrepresentable** — the compiler then prevents the runtime error.

## Total functions and exhaustive matching

Prefer functions that handle every case explicitly.

- **Exhaustive pattern matching** — when you add a variant, the compiler forces you to handle it (via a `never` / `unreachable` annotation or an exhaustive match).
- **A function returning an optional / sum shape is total** — every input produces an output. A function returning the raw value may panic on edge inputs.
- **Where the input space is small and finite, prefer total functions** to partial ones.

## Errors as values

Exceptions cross function boundaries invisibly. A return type that bundles a result and an error makes failure part of the signature.

- **Expected failure** (validation, lookup miss, network error): return a value-type error. The caller is forced to handle it.
- **Unexpected failure** (programmer bug, OOM, invariant violation): exceptions / panics are fine — they should crash visibly and be logged.
- **Don't use exceptions for control flow in normal cases.** A `try { ... } catch { /* ignore */ }` is silent failure.

## Anti-patterns

- **Type assertions** — syntax that tells the compiler to treat a value as a different type without runtime checks (e.g. `x as T`).
- **Lint suppressions** — a directive that disables a specific type-check warning (e.g. a comment that turns the lint off). The lint is usually catching a real issue.
- **Silent catch** — code that swallows an error without handling, logging, or re-raising it (e.g. `try { ... } catch { /* ignore */ }`).
- **`JSON.parse(...)` then immediate use** without schema validation — `any` in disguise.
- **Re-validating at every call** instead of at the boundary — duplicates work and lets invalid values leak past.
- **Boolean flag combinations** as state — encode as a sum type instead.
