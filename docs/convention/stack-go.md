## 0. Folder & file naming — strict

Names describe **what they own**. **Banned at any level:**
`model.go`, `utils/`, `helpers/`, `common/`, `ext/`, `adapter/`,
`driver/`, `platform/`, `infra/`, `kit/`, `repo/`.

If two helpers share a concept, **give the concept a name**:
`password_hashing.go`, `format_currency.go`. The path tells you what
the file does.

(Standard practice in the Go community: package names after the
concept they own, not the role they play — `auth` over
`auth_utils`. `spf13/cobra` and `go-kit/kit` both follow this.)

## 1. Directory layout

See §0 for the banned-name list.

### Layout A — small service (default)

- `cmd/<binary>/main.go` — thin entry point; constructs concrete
  types.
- `internal/<domain>/<domain>.go` — the aggregate: domain types, DTOs
  and sentinel errors (`User`, `CreateUserInput`, `ErrUserNotFound`).
- `internal/<domain>/service.go` — the contract: `type Service
  interface { ... }`, unexported `type service struct { ... }`,
  `NewService(...) Service`, and the default dependency interfaces
  (`Repository`, `Mailer`, …).
- `internal/<domain>/<verb>.go` — one file per verb (`create.go`,
  `update.go`, `query.go`); method bodies split by responsibility.
- `internal/<domain>/service_test.go` — the service's tests (§7).
- `internal/<domain>/postgres.go`, `internal/<domain>/memory.go` —
  concrete implementations of the dependency interfaces; the
  in-memory one serves tests and dev.
- `internal/<crosscutting>/` — a concern at least three domains
  share, named by what it is.
- `go.mod`, `go.sum` — module root.

**Rules for `internal/<domain>/`:**

- Split into `<verb>.go` only when the service has more than one
  verb. A single-method service lives entirely in `service.go`.
- Promote a dependency interface into
  `internal/<domain>/repository.go` (same package) when it grows and
  **other domain files** need it.
- Concrete impls sit where the interface is declared: `postgres.go`,
  `memory.go` and `<impl>/` live inside `internal/<domain>/`.

**Single file vs package** for an impl:

- **Single file** (`postgres.go`, `memory.go`) when impl ≤ ~300 LoC
  and has no private helpers worth isolating. Filename = vendor.
- **Package** (`postgres/`, `memory/`) when impl > ~300 LoC or owns
  private helpers / connection-pool / per-SQL constants. Folder name
  = vendor.

### Layout B — domain-rich service (5k–30k LoC)

Layout A's shape, with verb files grouped by responsibility and impls
promoted to packages:

- `internal/<domain>/lifecycle.go`, `internal/<domain>/billing.go`,
  `internal/<domain>/permissions.go` — method bodies grouped by
  responsibility (create/activate/deactivate, charge/refund,
  authorize/deny).
- `internal/<domain>/postgres/postgres.go`,
  `internal/<domain>/postgres/queries.go` — impl too big for one
  file.
- `internal/<domain>/memory/memory.go` — the in-memory impl, promoted
  the same way.
- Every other domain repeats the shape.

`service.go` is optional: a domain that is only types and persistence
has none. It arrives with business behaviour that coordinates multiple
dependencies.

A cross-cutting concern moves to its own `internal/<thing>/` package
past ~300 LoC.

### Layout C — library

- `<pkg>.go`, `<pkg>_test.go`, `go.mod`, `README.md` — all at the
  module root. `command.go`, `args.go` — one file per thing it owns.

### Root-level files

A root-level file exists when the module has that concern, and it is
named after the concern:

- `errors.go` — sentinels shared across domains (§4). Domain
  sentinels stay in `internal/<domain>/<domain>.go`.
- `config.go` — the module's configuration type and its loading.
- `logger.go` — only when logger setup goes past `slog.Default()`
  (§5). A project that calls `slog.Default()` directly has no
  root-level logger file.
- `httpserver.go` — server construction and route wiring, when the
  module serves HTTP.

Sizing, for each of them:

- **Single file (`errors.go`, `logger.go`, `config.go`, …)** when ≤
  ~300 LoC. Filename = what's inside.
- **Promotion to `internal/<thing>/`** when > ~300 LoC or owns private
  helpers. Folder name describes what's inside
  (`internal/logger/`, `internal/httpserver/`, `internal/config/`);
  the §0 banned-name list applies.

Multiple root-level files are fine: `errors.go` + `logger.go` +
`config.go`, each named after its concern.

### Project envelope

- `cmd/<binary>/main.go` is the **only place** that constructs concrete types and passes them to interfaces. Keep it thin.
- `internal/` is enforced by the Go toolchain. Use it for everything not explicitly public.
- `pkg/` is for code other modules import. Most services don't need it.

## 2. Module / package boundary

§1 owns the per-domain file inventory. This section states which Go
file declares and which depends.

- `internal/<domain>/<domain>.go` and `internal/<domain>/service.go`
  declare the types, sentinels, `Service` interface and dependency
  interfaces the rest of the domain is written against.
- `internal/<domain>/<verb>.go` and the impls
  (`internal/<domain>/postgres.go`, or `internal/<domain>/postgres/`
  past ~300 LoC) depend on those declarations.
- `mocks/` — generated by mockery (§7) from the interfaces declared
  in `service.go`.
- **The implementation lives with the interface it satisfies.**
  `postgres.go`, `memory.go` and `<impl>/` are in the same package, or
  a sub-package of it, as `service.go`.
- **A consumer imports the producer's interface, not its concrete
  type.** `order` imports `billing.Charger`; the compiler does not
  enforce this, so it is a review matter.
- Go rejects an import cycle at compile time but does not detect a
  `type → struct → type` cycle. Those are found by reading.

## 3. Naming

- **Packages:** single word, lowercase, no underscores. Singular for
  one kind of thing (`user`, `order`); pluralize only for genuine
  collections (`errors`, `flags`).
- **Types:** `MixedCaps`, no underscores (`UserService`).
- **Functions / methods:** `MixedCaps`, verb-noun (`GetUser`,
  `ParseToken`).
- **Constants:** `MixedCaps` (not `MAX_SIZE`). Group in `const ( ... )`.
- **Variables:** short in small scopes, `MixedCaps` for package-level.
- **Acronyms:** all-caps for the common form, consistent case
  (`HTTPClient`, `URLParser`, `ID`).
- **Receivers:** short, consistent across methods of the same type
  (`s *Service`).
- **Initialisms:** `URL`, `ID`, `HTTP`, `JSON`, `XML`, `API`, `SQL` —
  always uppercase or lowercase, never mixed.

## 4. Error handling

- Errors are values. Use `error` interface, never panics in libraries.
- Wrap: `fmt.Errorf("op x: %w", err)` or `errors.Join`.
- Sentinels: `var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")` +
  `errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound)`. Domain sentinels in `<domain>.go`
  (`internal/user/user.go` for `ErrUserNotFound`); shared sentinels
  in `errors.go`.
- Custom error types: implement `Error()` and possibly
  `Is(target error) bool` / `Unwrap() error`.
- Don't log and return — pick one (usually return; let the caller
  decide to log).
- Wrap at boundaries (network, IO, external calls), not on every line.

## 5. Logging & observability

- Stdlib `log/slog` (Go 1.21+). Prefer it over `log` and third-party
  loggers for new code.
- Levels: `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`.
- Required fields for HTTP / RPC handlers: `trace_id` (from
  OpenTelemetry's request context — falls back to a
  locally-generated UUID if no span exists) and `user_id`
  / `account_id` when the principal is known. The older
  `request_id` field still appears in many log pipelines but is
  really a stand-in for `trace_id`; new code emits the latter.
- Emit the operation name and key parameters as well.
- **Never** log secrets, passwords, tokens, full request bodies that
  may contain PII.
- Metrics: `prometheus/client_golang`. Define the registry once.
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel`).

## 6. Comments & docs

This section states the Go comment form only.

- Doc comments begin with the name being declared.
- Package comment in `doc.go` (one short sentence — e.g.
  `// Package auth provides ...`) is conventional and surfaces on
  pkg.go.dev. Long descriptions belong in `service.go` as a doc
  comment on the service struct.

## 7. Testing

This section states the Go test placement, tooling and test-name
form.

**Runner:** stdlib `testing`, files end with `_test.go`.
**Assertions:** `testify/assert` + `testify/require` (default unless
project says otherwise).

**Organization:**

- **External tests** (`package user_test`): next to source. Reach the
  unit under test through its exported API. **Default to this.**
- **Internal tests** (`package user`): same directory and package as
  the code under test. Use only when you genuinely need a white-box
  seam (uncommon).
- **`tests/` at module root:** integration / E2E tests that wire
  multiple domains. Separate binary.
- **In-process integration test client:** `httptest.NewServer`.
- **E2E tooling:** the binary under test is what `go build` produces;
  real services come from containers
  (`github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go`).

Within `internal/<domain>/`:

- Tests for `<group>.go` live in `<group>_test.go`.
- Table-driven subtests: `tests := []struct{ name string; ... }{...}`,
  run through `t.Run("case name", ...)`.
- Test names: `TestFunctionName` or `TestFunctionName_Scenario`.
- Benchmarks: `func BenchmarkXxx(b *testing.B)`.

### Mocks with mockery

Use **[mockery v3](https://vektra.github.io/mockery/)**.

- **Config:** `<repo-root>/mockery.yaml` (v3 — no leading dot)
  declares which interfaces to mock, output directory, package
  names, per-interface overrides.
- **Generated location:** declared in `mockery.yaml` via `outdir` per
  `interface:` block. Default: `mocks/<package>/<Interface>.go` at
  module root. When interface is scoped to one domain, set
  `outdir: internal/<domain>/mocks/`. Pick one convention per project.
- **Generation:** `mockery` (reads config) or `go generate ./...`
  when interfaces carry `//go:generate mockery` directives. Pick one.
- **In tests:** the generated mock satisfies the interface; pass it
  as a constructor argument (`NewService(repo, mailer, logger)`).

When a top-level domain depends on another top-level's interface, the
test for the consumer uses the consumer-side mock (generated from the
interface declared in the **producer's** top level).

## 8. Imports & dependencies

Three groups, separated by blank lines:

1. Standard library
2. Third-party
3. Internal module

`goimports -local <module path>` produces the third group. Plain
`goimports` emits two — standard library and everything else — so the
`-local` flag is what separates the internal module.
Use `go mod tidy` after every change. Don't commit `go.sum` updates
you don't recognize. `go vet ./...`. `golangci-lint run` if
configured.

## 9. Verification commands

These are the commands that sit behind the project's entry-point
names.

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build | `go build ./...` |
| Test | `go test ./...` |
| Test (one) | `go test -run TestName ./pkg/...` |
| Vet | `go vet ./...` |
| Format check | `gofmt -l .` |
| Format apply | `gofmt -w .` |
| Module tidy | `go mod tidy` |
| Lint (if configured) | `golangci-lint run` |
| Coverage | `go test -cover ./...` |
| Generate (mockery) | `mockery` (config) or `go generate ./...` |

A task runner (Taskfile, Mage, Make) wraps these under the entry-point
names; the underlying go commands stay the same.
